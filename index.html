In the process, we have executed numerous projects for a range of clients, including the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), GIZ, UNDP and the Soros Economic Development Fund (SEDF). </p>

                                          Throughout the recruitment and training of enumerators, survey piloting and management of field deployments, we incorporate strict quality control mechanisms in our research process to ensure the data we collect is trustworthy. We collect data using tablets, which allows our core team to review the data that has been uploaded at the end of each day, and randomly check-in on our field researchers.

Appreciating the inter-play between politics and local economic dynamics is paramount to providing effective technical assistance. Our team’s ability to combine their thematic expertise with local knowledge is at the core of the services we provide.
